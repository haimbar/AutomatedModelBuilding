\maketitle
\abstract{This repository contains code and data used in the paper \textit{Automated Model Building and Goodness-of-fit via Quantile Regression} by Bar, Booth, and Wells. Given $P$ predictors $x_i$ and $n$ observations for each $x_i$ and a response variable $y$, the goal is to build a model, $y=f(x_1,\ldots,x_P)$ where $f()$ consists of combinations of powers of the $x_i$'s, which fits the data well across multiple quantiles.}

\section{Prerequisites}
In order to run the code you must first install the \pkg{QREM} package. Since \pkg{QREM} has a model selection option for cases in which the number of predictors is large you also need to install the packages \pkg{edgefinder} and \pkg{SEMMS}. The recommended way to install these packages is from the GitHub repository:

\begin{Verbatim}
devtools::install_github("haimbar/edgefinder")
devtools::install_github("haimbar/SEMMS")
devtools::install_github("haimbar/QREM")
\end{Verbatim}

The model building algorithm is implemented in a function called \func{fitQRloop} in the file runQREM.R. The function takes five arguments:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textcolor{blue}{M} the data matrix with $P$ columns and $n$ rows.
 \item \textcolor{blue}{qns} The quantile which will be used in the fitting algorithm.
 \item \textcolor{blue}{minDiff} The minimal improvement in the overall goodness of fit in order to accept a new term.
 \item \textcolor{blue}{maxdeg} The maximum degree of any term in the model.
 \item \textcolor{blue}{maxrows} The maximum number of possible terms up to degree maxdeg.
\end{itemize}
The file initSim.R contains the values we used by default. It also contains three other variables which are used by \pkg{QREM} in the fitting process:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textcolor{blue}{mxm} The maximum number of segments in the partition of the selected variable.
 \item \textcolor{blue}{alphaQ} The level of the goodness of fit test.
 \item \textcolor{blue}{plotit} A Boolean variable which tells the function \func{flatQQplot} whether to show intermediate diagnostic plots for each accepted new term in the model.
\end{itemize}

\section{A Univariate Example}
The file Code/Univariate02.R  contains the code for example \#1 in the paper, where $f(x)=x^{5}e^{-x}$ and the random noise is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation which grows linearly with $x$, $sd=0.25(x+0.05)$.
\showCode{R}{Code/Univariate02.R}[3][15]
\runR{Code/Univariate02.R}{Univariate02}[cache]
\noindent The fitted quantile regression models are shown as red curves in Figure \ref{Example1}.

\end{figure}

\section{A Multivariate Example}
The program in Code/multivariate04.R generates a data matrix with 2,000 observations and 4 predictors, but only $x_1, x_2, x_4$ are related to the response,
$$y = x_1x_2x_4 + \epsilon$$
and the random errors are i.i.d. $\epsilon\sim N(0, 0.1^2)$

\showCode{R}{Code/multivariate04.R}[1][14]
\runR{Code/multivariate04.R}{multivariate04}%[cache]

The fitted model is: \inlnR{```cat(fittedModel)```}[vbox]
\noindent The predicted values are very close to the observed one, as can be  seen in Figure \ref{multivariate04}.

\begin{figure}[b!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{Figures/multivariate04.pdf}
\caption{Fitted QR model vs. observed values for $q=1/2$ where the true model is $f(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)=x_1x_2x_4$ with random errors i.i.d. $N(0, 0.1^2)$.}\label{multivariate04}
\end{figure} 

Examples which involve more complicated models with more than one predictor may take a few minutes to run. 

% The file Code/Friedberg7.R contains a multivariate example from the paper XXX, where the data matrix has 20 predictors, but only $x_1-x_5$ are related to the response,
% $$y = 10sin(\pi x_1x_2) + 20(x_3-0.5)^2 + 10x_4 + 5x_5 + \epsilon$$
% and the random errors are i.i.d. $\epsilon\sim N(0, 0.1^2)$
% 
% \showCode{R}{Code/Friedberg7.R}[10][19]
% \runR{Code/Friedberg7.R}{Friedberg7}%[cache]
% 
% Note that this example which involves a more complicated model with five predictors take a few minutes to run. The fitted model is: \inlnR{```cat(fittedModel)```}[vbox]
% \includeOutput{Friedberg7}[vbox]	
% 
% The algorithm did not select any variables which are not related to the response, and the terms in the fitted model represent the true model well. For example, $x_4$ and $x_5$ appear as linear terms in the model, and $x_3$ as quadratic. The combination of powers of $x_1$ and $x_2$ provide a good approximation for the $sin(\pi x_1x_2)$ term in the true model.
% The predicted values are very close to the observed one, as can be  seen in Figure \ref{Friedberg7}

\section{Case Studies}
The repositories contains several case studies:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Concrete.R - predicting the strength of concrete XXX. (Note that fitting a model to this dataset is time-consuming. Saved results can be found in concreteResultsR2s.RData)
 \item mpgreg.R - which factors contribute to gasoline consumption. (We run it 10 times, and it takes a minute or two to finish). The file MPG.py contains a python program which uses TensorFlow to fit the MPG data. The code was obtained from the TensorFlow documentation.
\end{itemize}
